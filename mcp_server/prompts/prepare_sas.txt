<task_definition>
Prepare comprehensive architectural artifacts and documentation that will serve as foundational inputs for creating a detailed Solution Architecture Specification (SAS). This preparatory phase generates structured technical documentation, diagrams, and decision records that directly feed into the final SAS document creation process.
</task_definition>

<context_and_purpose>
This preparation phase bridges the gap between Product Requirements Documents (PRD) and the comprehensive Solution Architecture Specification (SAS). The artifacts created here provide the technical foundation and architectural clarity needed to produce a complete, actionable SAS that development teams can immediately use for implementation planning.

The preparatory outputs serve as building blocks that will be synthesized, refined, and integrated into the final SAS document structure.
