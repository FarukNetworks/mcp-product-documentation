<task_definition>
Conduct a comprehensive, systematic review of a Product Requirements Document (PRD) to identify gaps, ambiguities, conflicts, and missing information that could lead to development delays, scope creep, or failed implementations. Transform all findings into neutral, actionable questions that enable the PRD author to improve document quality and completeness.
</task_definition>

<context_and_background>
PRD reviews are critical quality gates that prevent costly downstream issues during development. A thorough review catches problems early when they're inexpensive to fix, rather than during development when changes require significant rework. Poor PRD reviews lead to unclear requirements, missed deadlines, scope disputes, and failed product launches.

The review process serves multiple stakeholders: development teams need clear, implementable requirements; QA teams need testable acceptance criteria; business stakeholders need assurance their objectives will be met; and project managers need realistic timelines and resource estimates.

An effective PRD review transforms subjective feedback into objective, answerable questions that drive document improvement. The goal is not to criticize but to systematically identify and resolve ambiguities before development begins.

Target Audience: Technical leads, senior developers, product managers, QA leads, and business analysts responsible for reviewing PRDs.
Prerequisites: Access to the PRD under review, understanding of the product domain, and familiarity with the organization's PRD template and standards.

<structure_and_format>
Conduct a structured 3-phase review process producing a questions-only document:

**Phase 1: Preparation & Setup** (15 minutes)
- Review organizational PRD template and standards
- Understand the product context and business objectives
- Prepare review tracking sheet with standardized tags
- Set up review environment with necessary tools

**Phase 2: Systematic Review** (45-60 minutes)
- **Pass 1 - Structural Review** (15 minutes): Validate document structure against template
- **Pass 2 - Content Analysis** (30 minutes): Detailed content review with inline tagging
- **Pass 3 - Cross-Reference Validation** (15 minutes): Check consistency and identify conflicts

**Phase 3: Question Compilation** (15-20 minutes)
- Convert all tagged issues into neutral questions
- Prioritize questions by impact and urgency
- Format questions in standardized template
- Prepare final review document for distribution

**Deliverable Format:**
- Questions-only document in markdown format
- Maximum 20 words per question
- Standardized tagging and prioritization
- Clear references to PRD sections
- No proposed solutions or subjective opinions
</structure_and_format>

<review_methodology>
**Standardized Tagging System:**

| Tag | Category | Definition | Review Focus |
|-----|----------|------------|--------------|
| **A** | Assumption | Unvalidated statements or undocumented decisions | Look for "we assume", technology choices without rationale, market assumptions |
| **M** | Missing | Absent information, incomplete sections, undefined terms | Check for TBD placeholders, empty sections, undefined metrics |
| **L** | Logic | Inconsistent flows, impossible sequences, contradictory steps | Validate user journeys, technical workflows, dependency chains |
| **C** | Conflict | Contradictory requirements, duplicate definitions, inconsistent data | Compare similar requirements, check for duplicate IDs, validate metrics |
| **V** | Vague | Unclear requirements, unmeasurable criteria, ambiguous language | Identify subjective terms, missing quantification, unclear scope |

**Three-Pass Review Process:**

**Pass 1 - Structural Validation:**
- Compare document structure to organizational template
- Identify missing mandatory sections
- Check for proper requirement numbering and formatting
- Validate cross-references and links
- Tag major structural issues with [M]

**Pass 2 - Content Deep Dive:**
- Review each section for completeness and clarity
- Tag assumptions, missing information, and vague requirements
- Validate acceptance criteria and success metrics
- Check user stories and personas for completeness
- Identify logic gaps in workflows and processes

**Pass 3 - Consistency Check:**
- Cross-reference requirements for conflicts
- Validate consistent terminology and definitions
- Check for duplicate or contradictory requirements
- Verify data consistency across sections
- Ensure traceability from objectives to requirements
</review_methodology>

<examples_and_non_examples>
**Good Review Questions:**

*Missing Information:*
"Q-07 [M] FR-015 → What is the maximum acceptable response time for the search API (milliseconds)?"

*Assumption Validation:*
"Q-12 [A] §3.2 → Has the team confirmed AWS Lambda as the approved serverless platform over alternatives?"

*Logic Gap:*
"Q-18 [L] Figure 4 → Should user authentication occur before or after payment processing in the checkout flow?"

*Conflict Resolution:*
"Q-23 [C] NF-008 vs NF-019 → Which availability target is authoritative: 99.9% or 99.5%?"

*Vague Requirement:*
"Q-31 [V] FR-042 → What specific criteria define 'user-friendly' interface design for acceptance testing?"

**Poor Review Questions (Avoid These):**

*Subjective Opinion:*
"Why did you choose this approach instead of microservices?" (Contains implied criticism and solution)

*Too Broad:*
"Can you clarify the user experience section?" (Not specific enough to be actionable)

*Solution-Embedded:*
"Shouldn't we use Redis for caching instead?" (Proposes solution rather than identifying gap)

*Blame-Oriented:*
"This requirement doesn't make sense - what were you thinking?" (Unprofessional and non-constructive)

<tone_and_style>
Maintain a professional, constructive tone that is:
- **Objective**: Focus on document quality, not personal opinions
- **Neutral**: Ask questions without embedded solutions or criticism
- **Specific**: Reference exact sections, requirements, or page numbers
- **Actionable**: Every question should be answerable with specific information
- **Respectful**: Assume positive intent and focus on improvement
- **Concise**: Maximum 20 words per question to ensure clarity

Write questions that help rather than criticize. Frame issues as information gaps rather than mistakes. Use neutral language that enables the PRD author to provide clarification without feeling defensive.
