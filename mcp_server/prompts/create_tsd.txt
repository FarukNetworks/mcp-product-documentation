<task_definition>
Create a comprehensive Technical Solution Design (TSD) that serves as the definitive implementation blueprint, translating Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Solution Architecture Specification (SAS) into precise, executable technical specifications that enable development teams to build the solution without ambiguity or additional architectural decisions.
</task_definition>

<context_and_background>
The TSD is the final technical document in the product development lifecycle, bridging the gap between high-level architecture (SAS) and actual code implementation. It provides developers with specific, actionable guidance on exactly what to build, how to build it, and what standards to follow. The TSD eliminates guesswork, reduces development time, and ensures consistent implementation across the entire development team.

Unlike the PRD (what to build) and SAS (how to architect), the TSD focuses on implementation details: specific APIs, data structures, algorithms, error handling, testing strategies, and deployment procedures. It serves as the single source of truth for all technical decisions and implementation standards.

The TSD is version-controlled and frozen at sprint start, with changes managed through formal change control processes. Every development task should reference specific TSD sections, ensuring traceability from business requirements through architecture to implementation.

Target Audience: Software developers, QA engineers, DevOps engineers, technical leads, and security engineers responsible for implementing the solution.
Prerequisites: Approved PRD and SAS, completed task breakdown, understanding of existing system architecture and constraints.

</structure_and_format>

<examples_and_non_examples>
**Good Examples:**

*Component Interface Specification:*
```
## User Authentication Service (AUTH-SVC)

### Public API Endpoints
POST /api/v1/auth/login
- Request: { "email": "string", "password": "string" }
- Response: { "token": "JWT", "expires_in": 3600, "user_id": "uuid" }
- Status Codes: 200 (success), 401 (invalid credentials), 429 (rate limited)
- Rate Limit: 5 requests per minute per IP
- Timeout: 2 seconds maximum response time
```

*Error Handling Specification:*
```
### Error Handling Strategy
- All API errors return standardized error response format
- Retry logic: Exponential backoff with jitter (100ms, 200ms, 400ms, 800ms)
- Circuit breaker: Open after 5 consecutive failures, half-open after 30 seconds
- Logging: All errors logged with correlation ID and stack trace
- User-facing errors: Generic messages, detailed errors in logs only
```

*Data Model Specification:*
```
### User Entity Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    CONSTRAINT email_format CHECK (email ~* '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$')
);
```

**Non-Examples (Avoid These):**

*Vague Component Description:*
"The user service handles user-related operations and manages user data"

*Incomplete API Specification:*
"POST /login - authenticates users and returns a token"

*Missing Implementation Details:*
"The system should handle errors gracefully and provide good user experience"
</examples_and_non_examples>

<tone_and_style>
Write in a precise, technical tone that is:
- **Implementable**: Every specification should be directly translatable to code
- **Specific**: Use exact values, formats, and technical details
- **Unambiguous**: Leave no room for interpretation or guesswork
- **Comprehensive**: Cover all aspects of implementation including edge cases
- **Consistent**: Use standardized terminology and formatting throughout
- **Traceable**: Link all decisions back to requirements and architecture

Include code examples, configuration snippets, and specific technical parameters. Use industry-standard notation for diagrams, APIs, and data models. Focus on "how to implement" rather than "what to implement" (that's covered in PRD/SAS).
